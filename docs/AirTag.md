## Background Research

I started this investigation to learn about Apple's approach to electronics design and security in their latest products, especially at such a low price point ($29). I was particularly interested due to the similarities to my [Masters thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By4g-wZWsMlnaGg5S2JNRXRNWkk/view?usp=sharing) project in which I designed a small BLE device where battery life was also important.

The aspects that I wanted to investigate are:
- Hardware design to fit so much in a small enclosure (BLE, UWB, NFC, accelerometer, speaker, antennas) - [results](#hardware)
- Use of custom silicon vs "off the shelf" components - [results](#pcb-overview)
- Low energy design of hardware and software to maximise battery life - [resulsts](#battery-life)
- Implementation of the [claimed privacy](#privacy-claims) features to avoid unwanted tracking - [results](#privacy)
- Usage of recent BLE privacy and security features - [results](#bluetooth)
- Hardware and firmware security of Apple products - [results](#security)
- What modifications are possible - [results](#mods)

This section contains the research I did about these topics before my AirTag arrived on release day (30/04/2021).

### Privacy Claims

### Supported devices

Support for the AirTag was introduced in iOS 14.5. Apple lists which iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad devices are supported [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211348).

Removing the PCB is likely to cause damage due to the thin PCB and it being soldered to the plastic tray.

### PCB Overview

### Antennas

There are three antennas inside the AirTag:

1. Bluetooth Low Energy (left) - 2.4GHz
2. NFC (middle) - 13.56MHz
3. Ultra Wideband (right) - 6.5-8GHz

They are all etched onto a single piece of plastic using Laser Direct Structuring (LDS) and then soldered to the PCB around the edge. The NFC antenna also has a short trace on the other side of the plastic (connected with a via at each end) to return the inside end of the coil to the PCB.

#### Advertising data

This section describes the Bluetooth activity when the AirTag is registered to the FindMy network. 

- Address type: Random Static (changes daily)
- Advertising PDU type: Connectable undirected (ADV_IND)
- Advertising period: 2000ms

Byte #|Value|Description
:-:|-|-
0|0x1E|Advertising data length: 31 (the maximum allowed)
1|0xFF|Advertising data type: Manufacturer Specific Data
2-3|0x004C|Apple's [company identifier](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers/)
4|0x12|Apple payload type to indicate a FindMy network broadcast?
5|0x19|Apple payload length (31 - 6 = 25 = 0x19)
6|0x10|FindMy device type to indicate an AirTag? (0x00 seen from other Apple devices)
7-29|Varies|Assumed to be P-224 public key used by FindMy network. Changes daily
30|0-3|Status flags and/or ECC public key [odd/even bit](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc#public-key-compression-in-the-elliptic-key-cryptosystems)?
31|Varies|Crypto counter value? Changes every 15 minutes to a random value

According to Apple's [documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sece994d0126/1/web/1#:~:text=P-224%20public%20key%20Pi%20obtained%20from%20the%20Bluetooth%20payload), the BLE advertising data should contain a NIST P-224 public key. This key would be at least 28+1 bytes long but only 23+1 bytes in the advertising data ever change. Are they not using all the bits?

Apple presumably uses authentication to stop non-Apple devices connecting to the AirTag, as connections are terminated by the AirTag shortly after connecting. This could be investigated further to add some kind of Android support, although an Apple ID is needed to benefit from the FindMy network.

#### Unregistered behaviour

When the AirTag is not registered to the FindMy network, it has similar behaviour but advertises using its default device address at 33ms intervals, and with a different Apple payload. 

Byte #|Value|Description
:-:|-|-
0|0x1E|Advertising data length: 31 (the maximum allowed)
1|0xFF|Advertising data type: Manufacturer Specific Data
2-3|0x004C|Apple's [company identifier](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers/)
4|0x07|Apple payload type to indicate a FindMy device?
5|0x19|Apple payload length (31 - 6 = 25 = 0x19)
6-31|Varies|Not investigated yet

### UWB

TODO

### NFC

The AirTag uses the [NFC-A peripheral](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.nrf52832.ps.v1.1%2Fnfc.html) of the nRF52832 to implement an NXP MIFARE Plus (Type 4) tag in read only mode.  The NFC antenna is located behind the white cover, as shown [above](#antennas).

NFC is used to allow anyone who finds an AirTag to potentially identify the owner, even if they have an Android device. Apple describes the process [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212227#:~:text=If%20you%20find%20an%20AirTag%20or%20a%20lost%20item%20with%20an%20AirTag%20attached).

The tag can only be read when the AirTag is powered by a battery. It simply contains a URL to uniquely identify the AirTag, depending on its current state.

#### Unregistered
When the AirTag is brand new, has been [reset](), or has been [removed](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph869abb075/ios) from the FindMy network, the URL stored on the tag is fixed and the values do not change. It follows the following format:

```
https://found.apple.com/airtag?pid=5500&b=00&pt=004c&fv=00100e10&dg=00&z=00&bt=A0B1C2D3E4F5&sr=ABCDEF123456&bp=0015
```

Parameter | Value | Description
:-:|-|-
pid|5500|Product ID for AirTag?
b|00|Battery related?
pt|004c|UWB Precision tracking/Finding version?
fv|00100e10|Firmware version?
dg|00|Diagnostic code?
z|00|Unknown
bt|XXXXXXXXXXXX|Default Bluetooth address (hexadecimal)
sr|XXXXXXXXXXXX|Serial number of tag (alphanumeric)
bp|0015|Bluetooth protcol version?

While this data uniquely identifies the AirTag, it uses identifiers you would have access to if you were near enough to read NFC (<10cm) before the device is registered:
- The device's Bluetooth address `bt` is also used for broadcasts in this state (so could be captured by someone nearby during setup). 
- The serial number `sr` is not a secret. It is printed on the device under the battery (and on a sticker on the device packaging). It is also revealed by visiting the URL itself. Apple explain this [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211658).

Apple's servers accept any combination of values and parameter names. The only one used is `sr` and it can be empty. See [here](https://found.apple.com/airtag?sr=).
```
https://found.apple.com/airtag?sr=
```

I don't yet have another AirTag to compare the values across different devices. For a single unit the values are persistent across power cycles, long runtime, resets and modes.

#### Registered

When the AirTag has been registered to the FindMy network with an iOS device, the tag URL changes slightly to the following format:

```
https://found.apple.com/airtag?pid=5500&b=00&pt=004c&fv=00100e10&dg=00&z=00&pi=793f8d9fccaa91c3c177f32acf47160656873168d72f070cd925ce97
```

Parameter | Value | Description
:-:|-|-
pid|5500|Product ID for AirTag?
b|00|Battery related?
pt|004c|UWB Precision tracking/Finding version?
fv|00100e10|Firmware version?
dg|00|Diagnostic code?
z|00|Unknown
pi|Varies |Public identity (224 bits long)

In summary, the parameters `bt`, `sr` and `bp` have been removed and replaced with a single **anonymous** identifier, `pi` (not to be confused with `pid`).

`pi` is the only parameter that changes. It is updated at least every 15 minutes when the Bluetooth address and/or the advertising data changes. It is likely the current P-224 public key, or a SHA-224 hash of the key. It does not match the BLE advertising data which should contain the public key.

Again, most parameters are optional. The only requirement is that `pi` is valid. 

Apple servers can somehow connect this to a specific device as the page shows the corresponding serial number (maybe even before the AirTag has been registered) as well as the owner's lost message and phone number if available. Apple claims to not store any information about the AirTags and only the owner's phone and the AirTag can generate their rotating public keys.

The firmware function that generates this URL has been [identified](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1390639514134237186) by [@ghidraninja](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja). Further reverse engineering could reveal the meaning of the unknown URL parameters set by that function.

## Battery Life

The AirTag is supplied with a CR2032 Lithium coin cell from Panasonic. This has a nominal capacity and voltage of 225mAh and 3V.

![](img/airtag/CR2032%20discharge.png)

I measure a 2.3ÂµA load on the battery while the AirTag is idle. The [datasheet](https://industrial.panasonic.com/cdbs/www-data/pdf2/AAA4000/AAA4000C321.pdf) shows the expected capacity with such a small load to be almost the whole 225mAh. The AirTag will power up from a supply of at least 2V, which works well with the cell's cut off voltage of 2.0V.

This gives a **maximum battery life of at least 11 years** if the device never came out of sleep.

Achieving a sleep current of 2.3ÂµA is impressive given the nRF52832 alone uses 1.9ÂµA (at 1.8V) while asleep with RTC running, according to its datasheet. This means the rest of the circuitry is designed to be very efficient, minimise leakage and actively shut down or remove power from unused components such as the U1 and flash.

## Privacy

## Security

### Assets

TODO

### nRF52832

The nRF52832 has Access Port Protection (APPROTECT). This disables access to the Debug Port through SWD and prevents reading out the internal flash. Colin O'Flynn has [confirmed](https://twitter.com/colinoflynn/status/1390499614860644355) that AirTags do enable this security feature.

However, it is known that this protection is vulnerable to side channel attacks and can be bypassed on all nRF52 devices through voltage glitching as described [here](https://limitedresults.com/2020/06/nrf52-debug-resurrection-approtect-bypass/). 

We can assume Apple are aware of this exploit as it was disclosed in Q2 2020. This would have been towards the end of the development cycle for the AirTag so it is unclear if/how Apple addresed this risk. 

The privacy mechanism used by FindMy devices uses well documented cryptography and so is not dependant on confidentiality of the firmware. However, it would be possible to disable other privacy features that Apple advertise, or run completely custom firmware.

### Apple U1 

Very little is known about this custom chip designed by Apple.

It likely contains a processor as the flash chip [contains](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1390609884316635138) 64-bit ARM instructions that the nRF52832 does not support (discovered by [@ghidraninja](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja)).

### Flash

The 32Mbit NOR Flash is [not encrypted](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1390619216823390208). It is yet to be confirmed where/if the public/private key pair is stored.
